# Basic Computational Geometry


Each of five branches contains a single problem:


1. A. Point on the line segment (check whether a point lies on the segment or not)
2. B. Intersection of two segments (check if the two given segments intersect or not)
3. C. Point and Polygon (check whether a point lies inside a polygon or not)
4. D. Area (find the area of a given polygon)
5. E. Perimeter (find the perimeter of the complex hull of a set of points)
